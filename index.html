		<h1>Here is some centered content, by wrapping it with a section tag</h1>

		<p>Notice how if you change the width of your browser it stays in the center</p>

	<section>
		<p>This is a simple nav bar, which is full width of the page</p>

	<nav>
		<h3>A nice navigation bar</h3>

		<a href="#three">Link 3</a>

	<section id="one">
		<p><strong>Content number one</strong></p>
		<p>By setting an a tag's href to "#one", it will link to a html element with the id of "one". <a href="https://css-tricks.com/hash-tag-links-padding/">More info about that here</a></p>

			<p>There is also a section tag inside it to center this content</p>

	<section>
		<h3>Grids</h3>

		<p>Use grids to divide up or layout content. For example, putting an image on the left, and lots to text on the right</p>

		<p>I've added a 'show' class so you can see where the grids are. Use chrome's web inspector tools to take a closer look</p>


		<div class="g-row show"> <!--first wrap all grid cells in a g-row-->
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>

			<div class="g-30 show">
				30% width .g-30
			</div>

			<div class="g-70 show">
				70% width .g-70
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>The other cool things about grids, is that 50% width means 50% of the div's <em>parent</em>. This means you can put cells in cells to get infinitly smaller sizes. The possiblities are endless!</p>

		<div class="g-row show"> <!--first wrap all grid cells in a g-row-->
			<div class="g-50 show">
				<div class="g-50 show">
					<div class="g-50 show">
						50%
					</div>
					<div class="g-50 show">
						50%
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="g-50 show">
					50%
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50%
